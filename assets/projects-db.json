    "summary-2": "The game is called Life of Kim and it presents, as the title suggests, Kim, who is a teenager who loves gaming, and as a side note, has psoriasis. Her goal is to earn money to participate in a gaming contest, which can be done by playing mini games. As for the serious part, the game transmits information about psoriasis, its treatment and healthy habits through the dialogues and mini games.",
    "description-1": "In this project my main role was being the project manager. This was my first time in such position and even though the beginnig was hard, I asked for help and support and as time passed I became more and more confident in my role and myself in general. I have planned the meetings: What is our main goal? What is our goal today/this week? What do we have? What needs to be done? Who does what?. Also kept track of the requirements and our progress, was in contact with the client. Besides managing the work and plans, I have helped with implementing the game into Unity based on the prototype in Deig. These tasks included creating the main menu, the dialogue system with the help of Bolt and doing other smaller tasks, such as including audiofiles into the dialogues.",
    "description-2": "Life of Kim is mostly a narrative game spiced up with some minigames. The mechanics include walking around (by either tapping/clicking anywhere on the screen or the buttons of interactible objects) and interacting with objects or other characters, lastly, playing and solving minigames. The game has various locations with tasks waiting. We chose a narrative game because we thought that would be the best way of transmitting the message and information regarding this condition to the players. The player is informed about various things both by the narrator and other NPCs (mother, friend), which functions mostly as a feedback system (e.g. \"you shouldn't be afraid to wear clothes that show the skin irritation\", \"healthy food choices can milder your symptoms\"). The choices the player takes influences their energy level, which can either increase or decrease - thus, by choosing the \"wrong\" things, they might not have the energy to complete various tasks later on.",
    "description-3": "On the above picture a screenshot from a mini game can be seen. The point is to slide the shown food to the yes or no button based on what the player thinks whether they should consume it or not.

    "results": "On our meetings with the client, they were content and excited about the game, and it got positive feedback and was welcome by several people. I have participated as one of the representatives of the game at meetings with the client and other doctors/professionals. We got the opportunity to present our prototype and game idea at a Regional Meeting for doctors, in December 2021.",

The opportunities were endless, since Processing offers a great variety of visual graphics and tools for creating (almost) anything one would want. However, since studying game development, I chose to create a game.",
    "summary-2": "The initial idea was to create something fun, something that people (and myself as well) would enjoy playing. After trial and error with multiple styles, the two-player game, called avorado was born.",
    "description-1": "Processing allows a multiplayer aspect by using the keyboard and mouse input. That's how I dealt with creating this two-player game. The goal of the game is to compete against each other and try to catch as many avocado seeds as possible (\"Help Alfred get his seeds together\").    ",
    "description-2": "The mechanics may already be familiar to most of us, objects are getting spawned randomly and the player needs to catch it, if it misses, loses a life. This was the main base of my game as well, however, I've tried adding some extra things to it, to make it more fun and engaging.",
    "description-3": "This is how I have changed that seeds would get spawned on random places and would get a new random speed each time, making the game more challenging and giving it some variety. What it could make the game even better is adding some power-ups that pop up randomly as well, either something that helps one player (like a shield, extra life etc) or that harms the other (making them either super slow or fast, partially blind or many more).",
    "description-4" : "The duel between the two players can go on for quite a long time, depending on skills. For now, that player loses, who lost all of their lives, not based on score (this might need some balance maybe). An interesting thing was collision detection, which was achieved by a function namet get(x,y), which would get a colour number that an object is collided with. Based on the returned colour, I could give certain instructions in the code.",
    "takeaways": "delivered a game within a small timeframe, organizational skills, working under pressure, gained a deeper knowledge of Processing, ability to create something \"big\" with a recently learned software",
    "results": "Making the game was super fun. Not only I enjoyed creating it and playtesting it, but seeing my classmates and teachers enjoy it as much, or even more, as I do, was phenomenal. After the bootcamp we had an expo, where 15+ people tried Avorado, and I have gotten lots of great feedback and happy faces. Definitely a proud avocado mama right here. Additionally, while making the game, I have also helped my classmates who got stuck, with coding, which gave me a self-esteem boost and energy. I have really enjoyed it.",

    "summary": "a Figma hi-fi prototype of an app that motivates people to change their dietary habits in order to mitigate CO2 emissions and conducted qualitative research to evaluate the prototype",
    "summary-2": "One of several ways mankind can collectively do in order to fight the climate crisis and contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is by switching to a more plant-based diet. Serious games and various gamification tools have been used to raise awareness of current problems and motivate individuals to shift to a more “pro environmental” behaviour.",
    "description-1": "This study focuses on the perceived potential of a gamified application to make dietary changes, as well as on the perceived usefulness of gamification as a tool to achieving a certain goal. In order to seek answers to the aforementioned questions a prototype was developed and an online survey was conducted. ",
    "description-2": "At an early stage, paper prototypes and wireframes of the very initial idea were created (Figure 2), which later got tweaked based on previous work in order to maximise the potential of the prototype. To start with, there were some desired aspects to be included in the prototype, that is daily tracking (similar to a calorie tracker app, where several food items would need tracking), random facts, a currency that can be gained based on the user input, leaderboard, goals and challenges that help achieve those goals and lastly, badges.",
    "description-3": "The final prototype included various gamification elements that aimed to motivate people to use the app and follow their dietary goals. Examples of such elements: character selection that they could relate to, leaderboards and stickers, food logging, streaks, points, levelling up and unlocking items, impact statistics.", 
    "takeaways": "finding a problem and a solution to it, working with the supervisor and collaborating, work under (time) pressure, learning to fail and stand up, presentational and communicational skills, more experience with Figma, gained experience in researching and conducting studies",
    "results": "In conclusion, this thesis project has provided insights on the perceived potential of the prototype to change the approach of individuals towards a plant-based diet, as well as the usefulness of gamification and other aspects that may serve as a motivator to achieve dietary changes, as well as considering the parts of the prototype that may help with achieving the goals, or make the transition difficult. The results show that there is a potential of this specific product to help people transitioning towards a more plant-based diet. However, more studies ought to be conducted in order to see the true benefits of it.",

The green area indicates the radius of the mushroom within which it interacts with other game objects and damages the enemies. After placing the available number of mushrooms, the player can select the start of the chain explosion by clicking on one of the mushrooms and pressing the space button. The objects in the environment influence the impact and damage on the enemies, so in some cases the player might need some rounds in levels to figure out which strategy would be the best. The winning conditions is that all of the enemies have to be destroyed; it is not enough to damage them. The player only advances to the next level once every enemy is distroyed, otherwise, they lose.",

For this, I have chosen a minimalistic design, with little distractions, showing only the necessary information. Moreover, one of my goals was to limit the unnecesary steps and clicks, to make the application more effective. I have started with looking at some existing products to remind myself how does a similar app look like, after that, I just began sketching the wireframes.",
  "summary-2": "Since the overview of the map and the lines, with the indication of tourist destination is quite important, I chose to present it with a floating action button so that it does not distract the user from the main goal of planning a journey, but it is still there and visible, indicating that it is important.",
  "description-1": "For the details of the trip, I chose to use a dropdown to show them, to avoid extra, and possibly unnecessary steps for the user, making the app more efficient and user friendly.

  "description-2": "For the testing I have chosen a qualitative method, in order to get a more expansive and clearer feedback of the prototype and functionalities, that might be valuable in the early planning and designing phase. What I wanted to gather from this test is whether the whole layout and navigation is clear and clean, easy-to-learn, whether people get confused by the start page, as the to and from are switched and whether they get the correct data about the suggested trip, and the line overview (do they recognize what the letters mean next to icons, the duration, transfer etc.).

  "summary": "This assignment was to create an interactive, high fidelity prototype of the previously made wireframes. It was important that the prototype’s look would conform to the identity of the company. This for me, mostly meant that I would stick to the colours and shapes to the company’s logo.",
  "summary-2": "The plan, while transforming the wireframes into a hi-fi prototype, was to use the company’s colours wisely, and to keep the simple and clean look. I chose to keep a white background and add colours to smaller, yet important buttons and other things. Only the search bar is green, indicating a visual hierarchy, besides, the map overview is blue, indicating that it might be something important for the user as well.",
  "description-1": "I have chosen to incorporate the lines’ colours in the screen of the line overview, making it easier for the user to differentiate between the lines based on the colours without overwhelming them with too much colour (at first I used the line’s colour as background colour but it was too much for the eye). By giving each line a respective border colour, I had the same idea in mind: portray a better and easier overview of the things, making things possibly easier to remember, while keeping a realatively clean and less overwhelming look. At the tourist destinations I included some icons of the activities, to also contribute to the effectiveness of the application: when in rush, users can just take a glance on the activities and see what is there.",
  "description-2": "For this test I chose to experiment with desirability test, to take a different approach than before. I have chosen 4 specific screens to test, with 25 words. I have chosen these specific screens because usually these were the most controversial ones or simply had functions or looks I wanted to “double check” or gain deeper insight in some of the prototype’s parts to be able to decide on a final design. For the testing I showed each participant each of the screens one by one, asking them to describe them separately. When I felt the need, I asked them follow-up questions as well (such as Do you mean it is complex in a negative or positive way? What makes you feel like that?).",
  "description-3": "In conclusion, I think I mostly got the results that I expected or was hoping for. There have been some reccurring themes so I could gain a deeper insight on what to leave and what to change. Interestingly, even though the majority of the words were negative, people were almost always looking for more positive ones. Moreover, most of the negative words were repeating, making it clear which areas of the prototype are problematic.",
  "takeaways": "learned about hi-fi prototyping and design choices, gained experience with desirability testing, testing and interviewing skills",
  "results": "As the to/from part is still confusing for half of the testers, I considered a wise decision to change it. For this, I had to change my beloved line “Where do you want to go?” and just put “Plan your trip” instead. Another thing was trying to minimize the cognitive overload on the search results screen, so I removed the fields and just put the search condition on the top, thus ended up with a more ‘whitespaced’ overview of the suggested route.

The game is mostly story-driven, and there is a limitation of places to discover and elements to interact with. The story mostly progresses through dialogues, the choices taken and some interactable items. The idea was to present an engaging and entertaining narrative, which the use of the narrator, dialogues and conversations with other characters; and also by the responses different choices evoked. Besides these, I have created some banal or funny situations which not necessarily add to the outcome but simply serve more comedic purposes. The overall image of the main character was one way to implement the desired aesthetics (I wanted to evoke fun and enjoyment in the players), since his character makes believable that these situations could actually happen. I have also added Norwegian accent to the main character, as he is Norwegian and Swedish to almost everyone. This alone seemed to evoke positive reactions.",

There are branching dialogues with different outcomes (5 endings) that are also spiced up with the factor of randomness. The game is built in a way when almost every choice the character makes will influence the outcome, either by immediately failing or incrementing the “suspiciousness counter”. I have added many choices so that the player can feel a part of the game, where every choice matters and adds to the final outcome. I have also implemented a little feedback system. In some cases, when the “wrong answer’ was chosen I put a little feedback in form of an inner voice, that said “I should be more careful what I say in the future”, “That was close” etc. to remind the player that they took the wrong choice and think more about the next answer; and to remind them of the goal of the game, which is to successfully become a member of the Swedish army.",

It's hard to predict when to chose hasty or well-thought out options. \" \"The choices you make often contain fun reactions from the military leaders and other characters.
